# *Problem 5 questions*

## *Question: 1*
Develop a program using TDD

**Specification:**
1. Player of this game, usually a kid, has objects of several sizes, say circle, square and rectangles
2. Player also has a mat where he/she can place these objects
3. Player is given a few minutes to place these objects (do not try to create timers, this can be assumed)
4. At the end of the game we should be able to determine the area occupied by these objects on the mat

**note:**
1. Ignore overlapped objects since that is not the intent of this problem
2. All placed objects can have hard coded sizes
3. No external configuration is required, everything can be hard coded. Keep it simple
4. Step 4 of the test is very important
5. Write adequate tests

Use google mocks and gtest wherever necessary. The entire problem should not take more than 30 minutes to solve.
